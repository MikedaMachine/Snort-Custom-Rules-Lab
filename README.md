# Snort-Custom-Rules-Lab
The Create Custom Snort Rules virtual lab from CybrScore introduces the student to the creation of custom rules in an intrusion detection system (IDS). This will include examining the configuration and provides rules files for Snort and writing custom rules. 

This virtual lab is appropriate for intermediate students who have a solid understanding of networking. Once completed, the student will be able to create and use basic Snort rules.This lab will help develop knowledge of IDS and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) tools and applications, which is important for Cyber Defense Analysts and Cyber Defense Infrastructure Support Specialists. The lab will also help develop skill in detecting host and network-based intrusions via intrusion detection technologies, which is important for Cyber Defense Analysts, Systems Developers, and Vulnerability Assessment Analysts. The lab also helps develop the ability to apply techniques for detecting host and network-based intrusions using intrusion detection technologies - part of the Cyber Defense Analyst, Cyber Defense Incident Responder, and Information Systems Security Manager work roles. Snort is a common IDS and an understanding of how it works will benefit most positions in information technology. 

Skills learned: Configure Snort, Edit Snort configuration, Write custom Snort Rules, Analyze a PCAP file using Snort, Configure Security Onion IDS
